<p>Sadie is a German Shepherd, Lab, Retriever mix.  She is fully grown at 45 pounds.  There is one physical trait that sticks out the most about Sadie, and that is that her ears are too big for her body.  She accepts this about herself and does not let anyone make fun of her for it. She can stick up for herself very well.   </p>


<p>Sadie loves to run around and play with other dogs.  She is a very friendly dog and is always happy.  </p>

<p>When Sadie is not curled up in a ball sleeping, she is running around, jumping all over the place.  She loves to meet new people and puts a smile on everyone's face.   </p>
